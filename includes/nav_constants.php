FOR NAVIGATION WITH CURRENT CLASSES:

Step 1. Include the "nav()" function to each nav link with the variable inside of it's class: class="nav($L1);"
Step 2. Add the variable to the page link and set it to "TRUE" at the top of the page for the page you're currently on to add a class of "current" to that page link. 

I've included 5 but add new page variables as needed... */
